Fork GmSSL for optimizing sm9 pairing algorithm.

See GmSSL/readme to start!

Here, I have optimized sm9 optimal ate pairing algorithm. The pairing speeds up from 202ms(around) to 2.7ms(around) on MacOS
2.8 GHz Intel Core i7.

Here are some optimization algorithm about bilinear pairing based on GmSSL/sm9.

Arithmetic in extension field fp2, fp4, fp12.
Frobenius map in fp12.
Coordinates of points for Miller Loop.
Final Exponentiation.
Squaring in cyclotomic subgroup.
(The above five methods has finished and the two methods below are not done, but they won't make much difference)
*NAF in Miller Loop.
*Compressed form in cyclotomic subgroup.
